# NETWORKING

The network infrastructure contains three categories of hardware components, as shown in the figure:

End devices
Intermediate devices
Network media

Some examples of end devices are as follows:

Computers (workstations, laptops, file servers, web servers)
Network printers
Telephones and teleconferencing equipment
Security cameras
Mobile devices (such as smart phones, tablets, PDAs, and wireless debit/credit card readers and barcode scanners)

TCP/IP MODEL

Application Layer

Responsible for end-user services like web browsing, email, and file transfers.
Examples: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, SSH.
Transport Layer

Ensures reliable data transfer and error handling.
Protocols: TCP (reliable, connection-oriented) and UDP (faster, connectionless).
Internet Layer

Manages addressing, routing, and packet forwarding.
Protocols: IP (addressing), ICMP (error reporting), ARP (address resolution).
Network Access Layer (Link Layer)

Handles physical hardware connections, such as Ethernet and Wi-Fi.
Defines how data is physically transmitted over the network.

+--------------------+--------------------+

The two main models in computer network communication are:

OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model)

Consists of 7 layers:
Physical Layer – Manages physical connections.
Data Link Layer – Handles error detection and MAC addresses.
Network Layer – Manages IP addressing and routing.
Transport Layer – Ensures end-to-end communication (TCP/UDP).
Session Layer – Manages sessions and connections.
Presentation Layer – Handles encryption and data format conversion.
Application Layer – Provides services like HTTP, FTP, and DNS.
The OSI model is a theoretical framework used for standardizing network communication.
TCP/IP Model (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol Model)

Consists of 4 layers:
Application Layer – Similar to OSI's top three layers (HTTP, FTP).
Transport Layer – Manages communication (TCP/UDP).
Internet Layer – Handles IP addressing and routing.
Network Access Layer – Manages physical connections and MAC addresses.
The TCP/IP model is the practical model used in the internet and modern networks.

OSI Model and TCP/IP Model Comparison
Because TCP/IP is the protocol suite in use for internet communications, why do we need to learn the OSI model as well?

The TCP/IP model is a method of visualizing the interactions of the various protocols that make up the TCP/IP protocol suite. It does not describe general functions that are necessary for all networking communications. It describes the networking functions specific to those protocols in use in the TCP/IP protocol suite. For example, at the network access layer, the TCP/IP protocol suite does not specify which protocols to use when transmitting over a physical medium, nor the method of encoding the signals for transmission. OSI Layers 1 and 2 discuss the necessary procedures to access the media and the physical means to send data over a network.

The protocols that make up the TCP/IP protocol suite can be described in terms of the OSI reference model. The functions that occur at the internet layer in the TCP/IP model are contained in the network layer of the OSI Model, as shown in the figure. The transport layer functionality is the same between both models. However, the network access layer and the application layer of the TCP/IP model are further divided in the OSI model to describe discrete functions that must occur at these layers.

The key similarities are in the transport and network layers; however, the two models differ in how they relate to the layers above and below each layer:

OSI Layer 3, the network layer, maps directly to the TCP/IP internet layer. This layer is used to describe protocols that address and route messages through an internetwork.
OSI Layer 4, the transport layer, maps directly to the TCP/IP transport layer. This layer describes general services and functions that provide ordered and reliable delivery of data between source and destination hosts.
The TCP/IP application layer includes several protocols that provide specific functionality to a variety of end user applications. The OSI model Layers 5, 6, and 7 are used as references for application software developers and vendors to produce applications that operate on networks.
Both the TCP/IP and OSI models are commonly used when referring to protocols at various layers. Because the OSI model separates the data link layer from the physical layer, it is commonly used when referring to these lower layers.


ETHERNET frame 

An Ethernet frame is the basic data unit in an Ethernet network. It encapsulates data for transmission over LAN (Local Area Network) and includes addressing and error-checking information to ensure reliable communication.

Main Components of an Ethernet Frame:
1.Preamble (7 bytes) & Start Frame Delimiter (1 byte)

Synchronizes communication between sender and receiver.

2.Destination MAC Address (6 bytes)

Identifies the receiver's MAC address.
3.Source MAC Address (6 bytes)

Identifies the sender's MAC address.
4.EtherType/Length (2 bytes)

Specifies the type of protocol (e.g., IPv4, IPv6, ARP) or 5.length of the frame.
5.Payload/Data (46–1500 bytes)

Contains actual data being transmitted (e.g., an IP packet).
6.Frame Check Sequence (FCS) (4 bytes)

Provides error detection using a CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check).

ENCAPSULATION

Encapsulation in Networking
Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data with the necessary protocol information as it moves through the layers of the TCP/IP or OSI model. Each layer adds its own header (and sometimes a trailer) to ensure proper communication.

Encapsulation Process in TCP/IP Model
1️⃣ Application Layer:

Data is generated (e.g., an email, web request).
No headers yet, just raw data.
2️⃣ Transport Layer:

Adds a TCP/UDP header (Port numbers, sequencing, error checking).
The data is now called a Segment.
3️⃣ Internet Layer:

Adds an IP header (Source & Destination IP Addresses).
The segment becomes a Packet.
4️⃣ Network Access Layer (Data Link & Physical):

Adds a MAC header & FCS (Frame Check Sequence).
The packet is now called a Frame.
The frame is converted into Bits for transmission.

Decapsulation
The reverse process happens at the receiver's end, where each layer removes its header until only the original data remains.

Encapsulation (Sender Side)
Each layer adds its own header as data moves down the stack.

+---------------------------+   Application Layer
|         DATA              |   (Message)
+---------------------------+
|  TCP/UDP HEADER + DATA    |   Transport Layer (Segment)
+---------------------------+
|   IP HEADER + SEGMENT     |   Internet Layer (Packet)
+---------------------------+
| MAC HEADER + PACKET + FCS |   Network Access Layer (Frame)
+---------------------------+
|     0s and 1s (BITS)      |   Physical Layer (Transmission)
+---------------------------+

Decapsulation (Receiver Side)
The reverse happens as data moves up the stack.

+---------------------------+
|     0s and 1s (BITS)      |   Physical Layer (Received Bits)
+---------------------------+
| MAC HEADER + PACKET + FCS |   Network Access Layer (Frame)
+---------------------------+
|   IP HEADER + SEGMENT     |   Internet Layer (Packet)
+---------------------------+
|  TCP/UDP HEADER + DATA    |   Transport Layer (Segment)
+---------------------------+
|         DATA              |   Application Layer (Final Message)
+---------------------------+

IPv4 UniCast

IPv4 unicast is a type of network communication where data is sent from one sender (source) to one specific recipient (destination). It is the most common method used in networking for one-to-one communication.

IPV4 Broadcast

IPv4 broadcast is a type of network communication where a packet is sent from one sender to all devices in the network. It is used when a device needs to send data to every host in a local network segment.

Key Characteristics of IPv4 Broadcast:
✅ One-to-All Communication – The packet is sent to all devices in the same network.
✅ Uses a Special Broadcast Address – The destination IP address is set to 255.255.255.255 (limited broadcast) or the network’s broadcast address.
✅ No Routing Across Networks – Broadcasts do not pass through routers unless special configurations are made.
✅ Used for Network Discovery and Protocols – Commonly used by ARP (Address Resolution Protocol), DHCP, and other protocols.

IPV4 Multicast

IPv4 multicast is a type of network communication where data is sent from one sender to multiple specific receivers who have joined a multicast group. This is different from unicast (one-to-one) and broadcast (one-to-all).

Key Characteristics of IPv4 Multicast:
✅ One-to-Many Communication – Packets are sent to multiple devices, but only those that have subscribed to the multicast group receive them.
✅ Uses Special Multicast IP Addresses – 224.0.0.0 – 239.255.255.255 (Class D IP range).
✅ Efficient Bandwidth Usage – The sender sends one copy of the data, and routers distribute it only to devices that need it.
✅ Requires Multicast Group Subscription – Devices must subscribe to a multicast group using IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol).

TYPES OF IPV4 Addresses

Types of IPv4 Addresses
IPv4 addresses are categorized into different types based on their function and scope. These include:

1️⃣ Unicast Addresses (One-to-One Communication)
📌 Definition: Used to send data from one device to another specific device on a network.
📌 Example: When you visit a website, your computer sends requests to the server’s unicast IP address.
📌 Address Ranges:

Public IPs: Assigned by ISPs, used on the Internet (e.g., 8.8.8.8).
Private IPs: Used in local networks (LANs). Not routable on the Internet.
Class A: 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255
Class B: 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255
Class C: 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255
Loopback (127.0.0.1): Used for testing within a device.
2️⃣ Broadcast Addresses (One-to-All Communication)
📌 Definition: Used to send data to all devices in a network segment.
📌 Types:

Limited Broadcast (255.255.255.255) – Sent to all devices in the same local network, not forwarded by routers.
Directed Broadcast (<Network ID>.255) – Sent to all devices in a specific subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.255).
📌 Example: Used by ARP, DHCP Discover, and Wake-on-LAN.
3️⃣ Multicast Addresses (One-to-Many Communication)
📌 Definition: Used to send data to multiple specific devices that have subscribed to a multicast group.
📌 Address Range: 224.0.0.0 – 239.255.255.255 (Class D).
📌 Examples:

224.0.0.5 – OSPF (Routing Protocol)
239.1.1.1 – IPTV Streaming
4️⃣ Anycast Addresses (One-to-Nearest Communication)
📌 Definition: Used to route data to the nearest device (in terms of network topology) with a specific IP address.
📌 Used in:

CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) (e.g., Cloudflare, Google DNS 8.8.8.8).
IPv6 routing (widely used in IPv6 but less common in IPv4).

DYNAMIC ADRESSING USING DHCP

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network protocol that automatically assigns IP addresses and other network configurations (subnet mask, gateway, DNS) to devices on a network. This eliminates the need for manual IP address configuration.

 DHCP Dynamic IP Assignment Process

    [ Client (PC) ]      [ DHCP Server ]
         │                      │
  1️⃣  ───►  DHCP Discover  ───►  (Broadcast: "I need an IP!")
         │                      │
  2️⃣  ◄───  DHCP Offer  ◄───  ("You can use 192.168.1.100")
         │                      │
  3️⃣  ───►  DHCP Request  ───►  ("I accept 192.168.1.100")
         │                      │
  4️⃣  ◄───  DHCP ACK  ◄───  ("Confirmed! Use 192.168.1.100 for 8 hours")
         │                      │

1️⃣ DHCP Discover → Client requests an IP address (broadcast).
2️⃣ DHCP Offer → DHCP server responds with an available IP.
3️⃣ DHCP Request → Client accepts the IP.
4️⃣ DHCP Acknowledgment (ACK) → Server confirms assignment and lease

GATEWAYS TO OTHER Networks


The router provides a gateway through which hosts on one network can communicate with hosts on different networks. Each interface on a router is connected to a separate network.

The IPv4 address assigned to the interface identifies which local network is connected directly to it.

Every host on a network must use the router as a gateway to other networks. Therefore, each host must know the IPv4 address of the router interface connected to the network where the host is attached. This address is known as the default gateway address. It can be either statically configured on the host or received dynamically by DHCP.

When a wireless router is configured to be a DHCP server for the local network, it automatically sends the correct interface IPv4 address to the hosts as the default gateway address. In this manner, all hosts on the network can use that IPv4 address to forward messages to hosts located at the ISP and get access to hosts on the internet. Wireless routers are usually set to be DHCP servers by default.

The IPv4 address of that local router interface becomes the default gateway address for the host configuration. The default gateway is provided, either statically or by DHCP.

When a wireless router is configured as a DHCP server, it provides its own internal IPv4 address as the default gateway to DHCP clients. It also provides them with their respective IPv4 address and subnet mask, as shown in the figure.



 # Introduction to NAT

 Network Address Translation (NAT) is a process where a router modifies IP addresses in network packets as they pass through. NAT enables multiple devices in a private network to share a single public IP address for Internet access.

  How NAT Works
1️⃣ A device in a private network (e.g., 192.168.1.10) wants to access the internet.
2️⃣ The router with NAT replaces the private IP with its public IP before sending the request to the internet.
3️⃣ When the response from the internet arrives, the router translates the public IP back to the private IP and forwards it to the correct device.

#  NAT (Network Address Translation) in Action

        [ Private Network ]                [ Public Internet ]
  ┌──────────────────────────┐        ┌──────────────────────────┐
  │ PC1: 192.168.1.10        │        │                          │
  │ PC2: 192.168.1.11        │        │       Web Server         │
  │ PC3: 192.168.1.12        │        │      203.0.113.50        │
  └──────────┬───────────────┘        └──────────▲───────────────┘
             │                                  │

       │  NAT Router          │          │ Internet   │
       │ Public IP: 203.0.113.5 │          └──────────┘
       └───────────────────────┘

1️⃣ PC1 (192.168.1.10) requests a web page from 203.0.113.50.
2️⃣ NAT translates the private IP to the router’s public IP (203.0.113.5) and sends the request.
3️⃣ The web server responds to 203.0.113.5.
4️⃣ NAT translates it back to 192.168.1.10 and delivers the response to PC1.

#  Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Process

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is used to map an IPv4 address to a MAC (Media Access Control) address within a local network (LAN). It helps devices communicate over Ethernet by finding the hardware address (MAC) associated with an IP address.

 # How ARP Works (Step-by-Step)
💡 Imagine PC1 (192.168.1.10) wants to send data to PC2 (192.168.1.20) on the same network but doesn’t know its MAC address.

Step 1: PC1 Sends an ARP Request (Broadcast)
📌 PC1 broadcasts an ARP Request to all devices on the LAN:
📢 “Who has 192.168.1.20? Tell me your MAC address!”
✔ Destination MAC: FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF (Broadcast MAC)
✔ Source MAC: PC1’s MAC
✔ Target IP: 192.168.1.20

 Step 2: PC2 Sends an ARP Reply (Unicast)
📌 PC2 receives the ARP request (because it matches its IP).
📌 PC2 sends an ARP Reply directly to PC1 (Unicast):
✔ “I am 192.168.1.20, my MAC address is AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF.”

Step 3: PC1 Updates Its ARP Table
📌 PC1 stores PC2’s MAC address in its ARP cache for future communication.
📌 Now, PC1 can send data to PC2 using Layer 2 (MAC) addresses.
